</h2>

SwiftBlocksUI is a way to write interactive Slack messages and modal dialogs
(also known as Slack "applications")
using a SwiftUI like declarative style.

This repository contains the AvocadoToast demo,.

## How to Run

This demo requires a Slack bot authentication token, which can be found
on the 
<a href="https://api.slack.com/apps" target="Slack">Admin Panel</a>,
"OAuth & Permissions" section in the sidebar,
"Bot User OAuth Access Token".

```bash
Zini18:AvocadoToast helge$ export SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN=xoxb-YOUR-TOKEN
Zini18:AvocadoToast helge$ swift run
2020-07-17T17:13:12+0200 notice Î¼.console : App started on port: 1337
```

## How to Build

```bash
cd AvocadoToast
swift build
```

Or open the `Package.swift` in Xcode and build it there.


## Environment Variables

- `SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN` (the token required to send requests to Slack)
- `SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` (shared secret with Slack to verify requests)
- `PORT` (the port the app is going to start on, defaults to 1337)

## Requirements

On Linux this currently requires a Swift 5.3 environment
(swiftc crash, might be [SR-12543](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12543)).

On macOS it should work with Swift 5.2 (aka Xcode 11) and up,
though 5.3 has some additional conveniences.
